# gcs-spring-boot
This project comes from the barebones spring-boot sample that I downloaded:

https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-spring-boot

and deployed into Google Cloud Platform. It may still be running at the following site:

http://deocampo-barebones.appspot.com/

It is not a premanent site since I am using a free trial versions of Google Cloud.
